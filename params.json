Jon posts new demos and coding videos semi regularly on YouTube here: https://www.youtube.com/user/jblow888/playlists\r\n\r\n### But don't get excited...\r\nI don't actually know what I'm doing so this project is mostly a slow moving learning exercise. Right now it's largely a bunch of unit tests hoping to one day generate running code.\r\n\r\n### Hungarian? In 2015?\r\nYeah, I know this isn't a popular style, but it's the style used at my work and it's what my brain is used to. If it makes you feel better it's \"Apps hungarian\" not the \"Systems hungarian\" used by Microsoft in the 90's. (I know, you still don't like it.)",
